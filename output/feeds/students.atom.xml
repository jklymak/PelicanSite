This work is part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEOTRACES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSERC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCAR&lt;/span&gt;.  Ken is now busy analyzing observations collected in the region and seeing how they compare to the numerical&amp;nbsp;inferecnes.  &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Manman Wang Graduates</title><link href="http://web.uvic.ca/~jklymak/manmangrad.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-10T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2016-12-10T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Jody M.
