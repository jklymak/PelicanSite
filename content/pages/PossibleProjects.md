In collaboration with colleagues at UVic and the Institute of Ocean
Sciences, the Ocean Physics Group has a significant number of projects suitable for
graduate students at the MSc or PhD levels.  MSc projects involve
either numerical modelling/theory or data analysis, PhD topics ideally
will involve both.

## Applying

I am jointly appointed in SEOS and Physics and Astronomy.  Students
have the option of applying through either department. The physics
degrees require more physics courses to be taken, the SEOS degree more
earth-system-science courses.  

   - Physics Grad Program: [Calendar](http://web.uvic.ca/calendar/GRAD/GPROGS/PaAs/PrRe.html), [Department](http://www.uvic.ca/science/physics/prospective/graduate/index.php)
   - SEOS Grad Program: [Calendar](http://web.uvic.ca/calendar/GRAD/GPROGS/EaOcS/PrRe.html), [Department](http://www.uvic.ca/science/seos/grad/index.php)

While I want grad students, I *strongly* advise students to cast a wide
net and discuss projects with other potential supervisors.  There is a
wide variety of approaches and methods and finding a good match for
your personal tastes is important. 

Applying for an NSERC is always a good idea, particularly if you are
an A-student with research experience. Applications are usually due in
early October, the year before you apply for grad school.  

All students should **apply to UVic by
Feb 15th** to be considered for a UVic award.

## Observational projects

These are opportunistic, in that when we can get ship time or
participate in a project a data set is made available.  Currently, I
have datasets from:
   
   - internal wave and turbulence data from the continental shelf
   - dye dispersal, and tidal dynamics, in Saanich Inlet.
   - Velocity time series at the sill in Saanich Inlet.
  
Other data sets will be collected in the near future.  

Observational theses are less specified than numerical theses, as the
ocean does not always yield observational results in a predictable
manner.  The steps are usually:
   
   - characterize what phenomena are present in the observations
   - quantify the phenomena
   - understand what drives the phenomena
   - attempt to parameterize the phenomena

where the last integrative step usually requires many observations and
often benefits from theoretical and numerical insight.  

Observational projects are challenging, but extremely rewarding.  

## Numerical Projects

I believe numerical process studies motivated by observations are a
very powerful tool to improve our understanding of the ocean.  Student
projects are a little easier to specify in advance, and I do so here.

### Eddy separation around headlands

Grad student Wendy Callendar found that the tides produce headland
vortices around Cape St. James in the Queen Charlotte Islands.
Interestingly, on certain tidal phases these eddies coalesced into
larger mesoscale eddies that then spun off into the interior of the
ocean.  A  project would be to idealize Wendy's work and 

   - explore what tidal parameters set whether the eddies coalesce
   - explore the propagation of eddy dipoles from the shelf to the
     deep ocean.  

### Effect of bottom-enhanced mixing on large-scale flows

Turbulent mixing impacts the strength of the global overturning
circulation and the density stratification of the ocean.  However, the
turbulent mixing also depends on the stratification.  So there is a
potential climate feedback that has not been explored.  The goal here
would be to 
    
   - understand how a stratification-dependent dissipation should be
      entered into a simple model
   - how the simple model responds to changes in atmospheric heat
      forcing

### Ray tracing through non-canonical wavefields

In the open ocean, away from topography, the dominant way that
turbulence is generated is via the somewhat random breaking internal
waves.  The problem is analogous to whitecapping on the sea surface,
but without the wind's direct forcing.  Our understanding of the *rate*
of this process is arrived at by tracing "test waves" through an
empirical continuum of internal waves, modifying the waves until they
are of a small enough scale to break.  The continuum for these waves,
however, often excludes well-known frequency peaks such as those
driven by the tides.  The question here is how does the ray tracing of
the waves change as these peaks are made more prominent (if at all).
