### Lina Rotermund (2016-- MSc)

Lina is working with Bill Williams and myself on flow and tidal mixing in the channels near Cambridge Bay. Lina has already gone on one Arctic exploration tour, and was part of the team that discovered the wrckage of Franklins' lost ship the [*HMS Terror*](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hms-terror-wreck-found-arctic-nearly-170-years-northwest-passage-attempt).

### [Ken Hughes](http://kghughes.com) (2014-- PhD)

Ken is looking at the dynamics of Penny Strait in the Canadian Archipelago.

Ken's first PhD paper recently appeared in JGR:

### Manman Wang (2014-2016 MSc)

Manman is looking at the interleaving of water masses in the Labrador Sea as part of the
[VITALS](http://knossos.eas.ualberta.ca/vitals/) project.  Manman is submitting a paper, and is now working for Ocean Networks Canada.

### [Di Wan](http://web.uvic.ca/~diwan/Home.html) (MSc, with Mike Foreman)

For her MSc Di looked at the dynamics of Cayuquot sound on Vancouver Island, a
locale of significant fish farming.  Now she is working as a Research Technician at the Institute of Ocean Sciences and working on a PhD on the dynamics of the flow through the Discovery Islands and Discovery Channel with Mike Foreman and Stan Dosso

### Jeannette Bedard (PhD, with Svein Vaigle)

Jeannette was working with Svein Vagle on the hydrography and sound
speed properties in Cumberland Sound on Baffin Island as part of the
Ocean Tracking Network project.  She is now working with Ocean Networks Canada and and continuing graduate studies with Stan Dosso.  


### Emma Murrowinski  (MSc 2014)

Emma considered the energy transfers and turbulence caused when an
internal wave impacts a continental slope.  She now works for Rockland Scientific.  

[Murowinski, 2014](http://dspace.library.uvic.ca:8080/handle/1828/5336)


### Ryan Clouston (MSc 2013)

Ryan is looked at the amplification of exchange over sills caused by
tidal forcing.

[Clouston, 2013](http://dspace.library.uvic.ca:8080/handle/1828/4693)

### Wendy Callendar  (MSc 2009)

Wendy found that small-scale headland eddies generated by tidal flow
around a headland can coalesce into large mesoscale offshore
self-propagating dipole pairs. She now works as a Research Technician at the Institute of Ocean Sciences.  

Wendy's paper from her thesis appeared in Ocean Sciences:

[Callendar et al, 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/os-7-487-2011)

Her thesis: [Callendar 2009, (PDF 9Mb)](./pdfs/Callendar09.pdf)
