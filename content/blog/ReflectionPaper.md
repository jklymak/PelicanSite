We published our paper [Reflection of linear internal tides from realistic topography: The Tasman continental slope]( http://doi.org/10.1175/jpo-d-16-0061.1).  Data for this paper can be found [here](http://valdez.seos.uvic.ca/~jklymak/ttide15/).

This paper looks at how internal tidal energy is difracted, scattered and dissipates on the Tasman continental slope.  The story turns out to be quite complex, so we tease the various effects apart with a number of idealized simulations.  This work is part of the [TTIDE experiment](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/projects/ttide/) with colleagues in the US.
