Congratulations to PhD student Ken Hughes for publishing his first PhD paper (though he has a few from pre-PhD as well!).  [Water mass modification and mixing rates in a 1/12 o simulation of the canadian arctic archipelago.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016jc012235) is a careful investigation of the importance of mixing in the Canadian Archipelago in a regional-scale model run by Xianming Hu and Paul Myers.  This work is part of the GEOTRACES NSERC CCAR.  Ken is now busy analyzing observations collected in the region and seeing how they compare to the numerical inferecnes.
